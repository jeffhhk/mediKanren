# mediKanren

*** FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY ***

Proof-of-concept for reasoning over medical knowledge graphs, using miniKanren + heuristics + indexing.

There are several prototypes, each in its directory:

- [`attic/code`](attic/code) is the original prototype.
- [`medikanren`](medikanren) is the working prototype.
- [`medikanren2`](medikanren2) is the next-generation prototype.

Contributed use cases, queries and applications are now located in a directory separate from medikanren itself:

- [contrib/](contrib)

If you have previously contributed code applying medikanren and can't find yours, look there.
